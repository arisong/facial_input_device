```Introduction```
Initially, I wanted to do something that we saw in *the* scene in 'Minority Report', but it did not seem practical because there was so much arm movements. It looked exhausting. In the end, I did this, which replaces many (not all) mouse functions with facial movements, so that we can, for example, browse the web just by using our face. The script reads your facial movements via your camera and imitate mouse actions.

| Movements     | Actions       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Left eye blink  | Left click  |
| Right eye blink  | Right click  |
| Look left/right/up/down | Scroll left/right/up/down |
| Look left/right/up/down with mouth slightly open | Move mouse cursor left/right/up/down |

```Possible future additions```
1. Add speech transcription (so we can do away with the keyboard too)
2. Add voice commands e.g. to open Chrome
3. Use eye gaze to point the mouse cursor instead
